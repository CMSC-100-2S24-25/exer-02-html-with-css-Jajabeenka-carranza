                        I am a student in University of the Philippines - Los Baños taking BS Computer Science. I was born in Lopez, Quezon on February 12, 2002. My current interests are mostly aligned with the development of video games such as pixel art and game development across different engines but for now I am focusing on Godot. <br><br>I see myself in the future as someone who has a main job to fund my interest of making video games and side projects.
